# Orbit=1

Orbit is a bit processor.

The core concept of the Orbit processor is to
remove the artfice of a word size. Modern processors
perform computations on a fixed number of bits,
whether it be 8, 16, 32, 64 or in rare cases some
other specific size.

Since there is no predetermined word size, Orbit's
memory layout is also bitwise.

Operands for processing instructions must be in
the form of FROM and TO address pairs.
